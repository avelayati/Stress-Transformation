# Stress-Transformation
Stress transformation from principal stresses to fault planes or any other direction of interest

Required inputs: 
Principal stress values, the azimuth of the horizontal stresses, faulting regime

Optional inputs:
Pore pressure (to determin the effective stresses), strike and dip (for fault planes)
